# Acta 04 of the meeting of March 14, 2017. 

## Objectives

### Long term objectives, 
we can consider three phases in the building of the back end architecture.

1. http management (express.js)
    + routers
    + login (?)
    + getting information
2. Database management (node.js)
    + extract information from GitHub
    + data mapping(structure information)
    + store it in the database
3. database maintenance (express.js)
    + automated database maintenance tasks (?)


### Short term objectives: phase 1
1. give a JSon for Front end team to play with 
    * back end defines a Json : projects(e.g. given in , contributors (to review and to do together during a beer and code session)
    * Json to be suggested to Front end (could be done and suggested during the very same beer and code session)
    * once the whole team agrees, B.E defines endpoints and finishes the beer.
2. defines API routes with static files



## issues raised : 
do we really need a social login? At the moment, and for a minimum viable project, we thought that it was not necessary as we are going to extract public information.
At the moment, it was decided that for MVP, there wouldnâ€™t be any login or sign up from the application. 
At the moment, every participant needs to have a GitHub account.

## extra information
+[JSON lint to check whether a Json is properly written](http://jsonlint.com/)
