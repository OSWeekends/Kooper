# Acta 03 of the meeting of March 10, 2017. 

## To do (back team) before March 13: [Curso API REST con Node.js y MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUdlARNXMVkk7E88zOrphPyGdS50Tadlr)

+ Create a branch for each videotutorial.
+ Goal: practice and getting endpoints done with express directly, without save them in the DB.

## Defined the first backlog item (next back meeting March 15, 2017):

+ What we want in each endpoint?
+ Distribution of tasks and workload.
